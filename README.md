### Little story

It was in Saint Petersburg, 2017 year. My school sent me and other guys who intersted in mathematics in "Mathematic trip". We listened lections about analysis, algebra and geometria from different Saint Petersburg universities teachers. 
One day I found my friend looking up in monitor and deal some business. I asked him, what he does. He answered that he agrees with customer about bot.
After that he described me that he create bots for telegram and send it to many people. I was really excited! In one moment I lerned basics things about bots (it was the time when I finished reading book about python) and wrote this "masterpiece".

### Overview

Of course it is ugly and small project. But I think that the root of my programming interest must be there.
I could edit it or fully rewrite. But I sure that real date beside files means much more then good code for this project.
